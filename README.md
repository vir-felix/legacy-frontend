## Blinktrade Bitcoin Exchange

## Technologies we are using
- [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static generator in Ruby, to create the static html pages

- [google closure templates](https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/) for some of the javascript ui views

## Install the pre-requesites 
1 - Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/downloads/) anda [Java](https://java.com/download/index.jsp), in case you don't have them yet.

## How build the javascript application

Only needed in case you changed the `./jsdev` application.

#### Compile all Javascript

It will compile for all themes and languages.

```sh
./build_javascript.sh
```

#### Compile a specific theme or language
The defaults are US english (en_US) and the default theme ('default'), but can be overriden.
To build the british english version with a custom theme:

```sh
$ cd ./jsdev 
$ LANG=en_GB THEME=custom sh build_release.sh
```
